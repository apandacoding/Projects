# Basketball-Score-Tracker
The provided code is a Python program that retrieves NBA game data from the SportsData API for January 1, 2023 using an API key and a request URL passed through the requests library. The data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2 library. The program then processes the data using a pandas dataframe and creates a new column called 'Winner', which stores the team that won the game based on the scores. It visualizes the processed data using the matplotlib library by creating a bar chart that shows the number of wins by each team. Lastly, the program performs some basic data analysis by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the home team scores using the numpy library and printing the results to the console.
